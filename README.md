# PandasPoliceDataExploration

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that provides a detailed analysis of police traffic stop data in Nashville, Tennessee. Utilizing Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, the notebook explores various aspects of police activity, including gender disparities in traffic stops, arrest rates, drug-related incidents, and patterns in officer activities.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to analyze police traffic stop data to uncover insights into law enforcement activities in Nashville, Tennessee. The analysis focuses on:
- Trends in the number of stops over the course of 24 hours
- How often drugs are found during a stop
- Indentifying the officer with most active officer over the years
- How often a stop leads to an arrest
- The reasons for being stopped

## Dataset

The data used in this analysis is sourced from the [Stanford Open Policing Project](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/). This dataset includes detailed records of traffic stops made by the Nashville police department.

## Prerequisites

To run this notebook, you will need:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas library
